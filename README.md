Predict the popularity of shelter pet photos

A picture is worth a thousand words. But did you know a picture can save a thousand lives? Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day
around the world. You might expect pets with attractive photos to generate more interest and be adopted faster. But what makes a good picture? With the help of data science, you 
may be able to accurately determine a pet photo’s appeal and even suggest improvements to give these rescue animals a higher chance of loving homes. PetFinder.my is Malaysia’s 
leading animal welfare platform, featuring over 180,000 animals with 54,000 happily adopted. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global 
organizations to improve animal welfare. Currently, PetFinder.my uses a basic Cuteness Meter to rank pet photos. It analyzes picture composition and other factors compared to 
the performance of thousands of pet profiles. While this basic tool is helpful, it's still in an experimental stage and the algorithm could be improved.
